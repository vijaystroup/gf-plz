Automate my way to a girlfriend

This project has 2 components.
1. Gathering data (images) and processing them for ml
2. Predicting whether or not someone is attractive

Unfortunally, with such the diverse imgery in Tinder selfies, the amount of data I had was not trainable for a NN.
I then tried to implement transfer learning, but was unsucessful.
